# Theo health web app

The project is a prototype of a web-based application designed to provide its users with an intuitive visual representation of their progress during their recovery from a physical injury. The mental toll that can be had by an athlete of any caliber suffering a serious injury can be immense, the lifestyle that these individuals live can be wholly turned on its head as an athlete goes from peak physical condition to being nearly unable to lift an arm. This sudden change can lead to tough mental battles and even depression. It is with this in mind that we are aiming to deliver a prototype of an application that can give easy to understand visual feedback to these individuals throughout their recovery process even when they may not be able to feel this progress physically.

The prototype will show an image of the human body with a heatmap superimposed onto it. This heat map will show colours from green through to red as a way of representing low and high muscle load respectively as recorded with MyoWare muscle sensors. The data shown in these visual representations will be specific to individual sessions of squats carried out by the user and will be accessible both by the user themselves and their assigned physiotherapist.

The user base of the project will be primarily recovering athletes and their physiotherapists. Athletes will have access to their own sessions and all stats related to said sessions whereas physiotherapists will have access to all data stored on their clients, of which each  physiotherapist will have multiple.
